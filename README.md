## Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

- **Column Removal:**  
  Removed irrelevant columns for the analysis: `Exercise Hours`, `Diabetes`, `Obesity`, `Stress Level`, `Blood Sugar`, `Exercise Induced Angina`, and `Chest Pain Type`.

- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  - Filled in missing values in the `Alcohol Intake` column with "No" assuming that person is a non drinker.

- **Duplicates:**  
  Checked for duplicates and there are no duplicates in the data set

- **Outlier Detection:**  
  No outliers detected.

## Bivariate Analysis

### Age vs Heart Disease
![Correlation Matrix](images/Correlation%20matrix%20age%20heart%20disease.png)

The correlation matrix shows a strong positive correlation (0.6469) between age and heart disease, indicating that as age increases, the likelihood of heart disease also tends to increase.

![Age vs Heart Disease](images/Bvariate%20analysis%20age%20heart%20disease.png)

 No cases are observed in individuals under 40, while the 40-60 age group shows a moderate presence. In contrast, the majority of cases occur in those over 60, highlighting the strong correlation between aging and heart disease.The prevalence of heart disease increases significantly with age, making it a major risk factor. 
 
### Cholesterol vs Heart Disease
![Correlation Matrix](images/correlation%20matrix%20cholesterol%20heart%20disease.png)

The correlation matrix shows a moderate positive correlation (0.3650) between cholesterol levels and heart disease, suggesting that higher cholesterol is associated with an increased likelihood of heart disease, though other factors may also contribute.

![Cholesterol vs Heart Disease](images/bivariate%20analysis%20cholesterol%20heart%20disease.png)

Higher cholesterol levels are associated with an increased prevalence of heart disease. In the low cholesterol category, only 42 patients have heart disease (vs. 296 without), while in the medium and high categories, heart disease cases rise to 172 (vs. 161) and 178 (vs. 151), respectively, highlighting cholesterol as a key risk factor.

### Blood Pressure vs Heart Disease
![Correlation Matrix](images/correlation%20matrix%20blood%20pressure%20heart%20disease.png)

The correlation matrix shows a very weak positive correlation (0.0069) between blood pressure and heart disease, suggesting that blood pressure has little to no direct linear relationship with heart disease in this dataset.

![Blood Pressure vs Heart Disease](images/bivariate%20analysis%20blood%20pressure%20heart%20disease.png)

Blood pressure levels do not show a strong association with heart disease, as cases remain relatively consistent across categories: 133 (vs. 209) in low, 131 (vs. 194) in medium, and 128 (vs. 205) in high blood pressure groups.

### Heart Rate vs Heart Disease
![Correlation Matrix](images/correlation%20matrix%20heart%20rate%20heart%20disease.png)

The correlation matrix shows a very weak positive correlation (0.0132) between heart rate and heart disease, indicating that heart rate has little to no direct linear relationship with heart disease in this dataset.

![Heart Rate vs Heart Disease](images/bivariate%20analysis%20heart%20rate%20heart%20disease.png)

Heart rate shows no clear association with heart disease, as the number of cases remains relatively consistent across low (132 vs. 204), medium (124 vs. 209), and high (136 vs. 195) heart rate categories.

## Multivariate Analysis

### Pair Plot 
![Pair Plot](images/pairplot.png)

The pair plot visualizes relationships between age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate with heart disease. It highlights a strong association between age and heart disease, with older individuals more likely affected. Cholesterol shows some correlation, while blood pressure and heart rate appear to have weaker associations.

### Correlation Heat Map
![Correlation Heat Map](images/correlation%20heat%20map.png)

The correlation heatmap shows weak correlations among age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate, with all values close to zero. This suggests that these variables are largely independent of each other in this dataset.

### Mean Values
![Mean Values](images/mean%20values.png)

The mean values for patients without heart disease (Heart Disease = 0) show an average age of 44.13, cholesterol level of 232.97, blood pressure of 135.13, and heart rate of 79.08. For patients with heart disease (Heart Disease = 1), the averages are higher, with an age of 64.96, cholesterol level of 276.26, blood pressure of 135.51, and heart rate of 79.39. This suggests that older age and higher cholesterol levels are more prevalent in those with heart disease
